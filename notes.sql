-- lookup vs fact tables
-- what was the name of that group? that does data warehouses? (kimball group)

-- this big case/when statement returns "USER BANNED" in a "cancellation_type" column

-- lookup table

-- and reasons in 1

-- max(cancel_value)
-- ?? so there is some prioritization going on

-- nested query in a column
